Open source underwater glider

The SeaFlight Glider is an open source underwater AUV that is designed to be robust, repairable, sustainable and constructed from easily machined or off the shelf parts.
Glider durability and reliability remain a challenge well-recognized by the community and only partly mitigated by experience, training, and quality management best-practices.
